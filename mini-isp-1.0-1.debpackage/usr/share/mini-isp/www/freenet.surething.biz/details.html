is Freenet WiFi</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Freenet is
funded and operated by  individuals and volunteers - in one sense,
like public television.  Freenet was created by a group of people who
felt there was a need to have  high speed access to the Internet in
all the places they might use them.  At the time there were already
WiFi points near by but none were at a price that seemed fair.  The
group now named The Freenet Group found that as a group they could
share access to one or many access points at a fraction of the cost
of what it then cost to connect to other systems.  As a group they
found they could pool resources and money to make a better and faster
system.    Freenet is a nonprofit organization.  The money that is
received goes to continued operation, system maintenance and in
making improvements in the system.  Improvements include extending
the range of operation and adding higher speed Internet access from
our providers.   The growth and continued existence relies on your
donations.  So please donotate what you feel the service is worth to
you.  Remember you are not only helping yourself but everyone around
you that can also make use of it. </B></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    <FONT SIZE=4><B>We are
also looking for more locations to install more access points.  If
you have access to a location that already has a phone line or better
yet ADSL service  you are willing to share,   please contact us.  We
(our staff) will study the locations provided and decide the best
locations for expansion that we feel will provide the best benefit to
the community.</B></FONT></P>
